# Bionic Hand – Myoelectric Gesture-Controlled Prosthetic Arm

This project is a low-cost, gesture-controlled prosthetic arm using EMG (Electromyography) signals. It is designed to assist individuals with upper-limb disabilities by enabling intuitive control through muscle signals.

## Key Features
- EMG-based gesture recognition (open/close hand, pinch)
- Arduino UNO microcontroller
- 5 servo motor-controlled fingers
- 3D-printed mechanical structure
- Real-time control via muscle movement
- Clean signal processing using MAF (Moving Average Filter) and RMS (Root Mean Square) filtering for noise reduction

## Inspiration
Inspired by industry leaders such as **Psyonic**, a US-based startup behind the Ability Hand™, this project strives to bring affordability, accessibility, and local innovation to advanced prosthetics. While commercial-grade bionic arms remain expensive and complex, our goal is to bridge that gap for underserved communities using open-source, modular design.

## Future Scope
- Integration of **Machine Learning** models (e.g., SVM, CNN) for multi-gesture classification and individual finger control.
- Multi-channel EMG support with adaptive thresholding.
- Enhanced comfort and wearability with ergonomic design.
- Wireless module integration for untethered operation.
- Dataset creation for gesture classification research.
